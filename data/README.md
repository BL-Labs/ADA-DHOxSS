### How we created the sample

We used the extra metadata file to pick books in English, and sample 120 books for each of the four categories provided there: prose, poetry, music and drama. We only picked the first volumes for books with more than one volume. Some of the books in the sample did not have an associated fulltext, hence we dropped them, resulting in 452 books/volumes. 

More details are given in the [BL_sample notebook](bl_books/BL_sample.ipynb).
